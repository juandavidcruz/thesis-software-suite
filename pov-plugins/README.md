# Point of View projects
This repository contains several [Tulip](http://tulip.labri.fr) plugins that belong to the PhD thesis of Juan David Cruz-Gomez. Most of the plugins were developped between 2010 and 2012, while others like the PoVLayoutPlugin has ben updated since.

## Why Point of View?
The Point of View is anotion we try to develop to indicate that the set of features describing a person can be divided into several different subsets that can be compared with other individuals. 
The basic idea is that, besides the potential high dimensional problems that may arise, using the whole set of attributes for comparing users may result bad results, mainly because of the singularity of each actor.

## Compiling and installing the plugins
###Prerequisites
* A reasonable good C++ compiler (I use gcc 4.7.2)
* Install CMake
* QT4 with devel libraries
* Install the basic algorithms:
	* Clustering
	* Visualization

###Compiling the code
* Go to the base folder:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~$ cd path-to-repo/software-suite/pov-plugins
~~~~
* Create a build folder and go into it:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/pov-plugins$ mkdir build
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/pov-plugins$ cd build
~~~~
* Configure with Cmake:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/pov-plugins/build$ cmake -DTULIP_DIR=/home/juancrug/tulip3 \
  -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/home/juancrug/tulip3/share/tulip \
  -DATLAS_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DMATRIX_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DMDS_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DBASE_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  ..
~~~~
**Note:** replace the configuration paths with your own, custom paths.

* Build and install:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib/build$ make && make install
~~~~

At this stage the libraries should be installed in the Tulip install path. These are the libraries that should be installed:
~~~~
libDimacsLoaderPlugin-3.8.0.so
libLouvainCommunityDetection-3.8.0.so
libPoVCommunityDetection-3.8.0.so
libPoVCommunityLayoutPluginV2-3.8.0.so
libPoVCommunityColoringLayoutPlugin-3.8.0.so
libPoVViewPlugin-3.8.0.so
