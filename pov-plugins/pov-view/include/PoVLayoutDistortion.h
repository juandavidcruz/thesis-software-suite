/**
 * This class provides methods to apply a distortion operation to a given layout to show the impact of a selected point of view.
 * The idea is: given a point of view (and the partition induced by it) calculate the centroids of the nodes inside the interaction
 * zone belonging to each community in the partition induced by the point of view. These centroids allow having influence zones,
 * calculated according to the size of the nodes involved.
 * Then, the nodes will be pushed near their centroids to see how interacting node are similar in terms of the point of view. The last
 * step is to change the colors of the inner nodes (and the border nodes maybe?) according to the partition induced by the point of view.
 * This belong to the model layer.
