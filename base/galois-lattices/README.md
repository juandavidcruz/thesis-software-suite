# Galois lattices extraction algorithm

This is the implementation of the Galois lattice extraction algorithm proposed by [Vicky Choi, 2006](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0602069).

One of the problems, or classic bottlenecks, is the concept lookup during the construction of the lattice, i.e., before adding a closed concept to the lattice, it is mandatory to check if that concept already exists. TO improve the search time I use a [trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

## Compiling and installing the algorithms
###Requisites
* A reasonable good C++ compiler (I use gcc 4.7.2)
* Install CMake

###Compiling the code
* Go to the base folder:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~$ cd path-to-repo/software-suite/base/galois-lattices
~~~~
* Create a build folder and go into it:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/galois-lattices/$ mkdir build
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/galois-lattices/$ cd build
~~~~
* Configure with Cmake:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/galois-lattices/build$ cmake -DPREFIX=/home/juancrug ..
~~~~
**Note:** replace the configuration paths with your own, custom paths.

* Build and install:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/galois-lattices/build$ make && make install
~~~~

At this stage the libraries should be installed in /PREFIX/lib while the public interfaces (.h files) should be in /PREFIX/
