# Matrix manipulation library

This is a really basic library for manipulating matrices, including multiplication, sum, column and row sum. 

Since I've wrote this for my own projects, other functions may be added in the future, sorry for the inconvenience.

One interesting feature is the memory recycling that is done when the same operation is performed over matrices of different size. I made this for coping with the memory when writing the MDS-SMACOF algorithm. In such a way the library asks for memory for the biggest matrix, and then it starts to reusing this space for the other matrices, just changing the limits (size of the matrix) as needed.

I wrote this as a part of my PhD thesis, sometimes in a rush, however I tried to write tidy code and neat documentation, if you find some trouble using this piece of software, please forgive me.

If you have any comment please, feel free to [drop me a line](juan.cruzgomez@telecom-bretagne.eu).

## Compiling and installing the algorithms
###Requisites
* A reasonable good C++ compiler (I use gcc 4.7.2)
* Install CMake
* An ATLAS installation (Please refer to the [http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/atlas_install/atlas_install.html](ATLAS installation page) for
further information regarding the configuration)

###Compiling the code
* Go to the base folder:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~$ cd path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib
~~~~
* Create a build folder and go into it:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib/$ mkdir build
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib/$ cd build
~~~~
* Configure with Cmake:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib/build$ cmake -DATLAS_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DPREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  ..
~~~~
**Note:** replace the configuration paths with your own, custom paths.

* Build and install:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/base/matrix-lib/build$ make && make install
~~~~

At this stage the libraries should be installed in /PREFIX/lib while the public interfaces (.h files) should be in /PREFIX/

## What next?

Now you should have a basic, yet nice, matrix library that hides the calls to
ATLAS (and in the future, to CUBLAS). 

Remember that this library is part of a bigger project.
