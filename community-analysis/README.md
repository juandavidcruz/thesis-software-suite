# Community analysis platform
This repository contains an initial version of a platform that can be used to test different community detection algorithms.

The basic idea is to instantiate different community detection algorithms and compare their results.

The implemented algorithms are:

* Point of view community detection
* Galois clustering
* Louvain's algorithm
* Other data mining algorithms:
    * K-means
    * PageRank based k-means
    * SOM

The idea here is to add experiments that derive from the ClusteringBase class.

## Compiling and installing the algorithms
###Requisites
* Install CMake
* Install Tulip 3.8 with development libraries
* Install the base and algorith libraries

###Compiling the code
* Go to the base folder:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~$ cd path-to-repo/software-suite/community-analysis
~~~~
* Create a build folder and go into it:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/community-analysis/$ mkdir build
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/community-analysis/$ cd build
~~~~
* Configure with Cmake:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/community-analysis/build$ cmake -DTULIP_DIR=/home/juancrug/tulip3 \
  -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/home/juancrug/tulip3/share/tulip \
  -DATLAS_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DBASE_PREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  -DPREFIX=/home/juancrug \
  ..
~~~~
**Note:** replace the configuration paths with your own, custom paths.

* Build and install:
~~~~
juancrug@juandavid-office:~/path-to-repo/software-suite/community-analysis/build$ make
~~~~

At this stage the libraries should be installed in /PREFIX/lib while the public interfaces (.h files) should be in /PREFIX/

## Using it
Take a look to the main.cpp file.
